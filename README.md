# Rand-sequence
Java GUI which generate a random sequence from a list of persons. Ideally for pass order.

The project is still in a design stage and the main reason to develop something already existing in the market is  first to have fun programming java gui's, and to use it in my class to determine the pass order for presentations/exams etc...
